# Converting numbers-to-text and text-to-numbers
First project of the "Advanced Programming" course \
In this project, by giving an input number (e.g. 2020), the code generates the number's equivalent in text (i.e. Two Thousand and Twenty). And by giving an input text (e.g. Two Thousand and Twenty) the code generates the equivalent in numbers (i.e. 2020). One other interesting feature of the code is the ability to process numbers with decimals.
